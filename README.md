## Moodle Cleaner

This project is aim to resolve currently terrible UX of HKU Moodle page. Currently there is no method for user to adjust the contents of the page without resorting to JavaScript.

Some examples include:

1. Cannot hide courses of the past semesters.
2. Cannot change the order of the courses or how they are rendered.
3. The links are not sorted according to the course code, which should be very easy function to add from Moodle developer.

Moodle changes their UI in July, but they don't know where the problem is.

## Functions

The extension allows user to sort the side navigation bar according to keys such as course codess, academic year/semester, or self-defined significance.

User can also filter the courses they want to see, they can provide which year and which semester of courses to render. They can also provide course code prefixes such as `COMP`.

They can also tidy up majority of contents in the main body part, and render some buttons to help them navigate to course page without looking for the hyperlink. In the first version of extension, these buttons will be the same with the ones on the side bar.

### Progress

The first production is due by the end of August, before the semester begins.

### PR

Of course welcome.
